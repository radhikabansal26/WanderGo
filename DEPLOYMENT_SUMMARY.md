## 📱 Expected Users (Your Use Case)

For a capstone project, you'll have:
- **5-10 group members** testing
- **1-3 professors** evaluating
- **10-20 recruiters** viewing portfolio
- **Total: ~20-50 users** (perfect for free tier!)

**Free tier limits:**
- Vercel: 100GB bandwidth/month (≈ 10,000 page visits)
- Render: 750 hours/month (24/7 uptime for 1 month)
- MongoDB: 512MB storage (thousands of itineraries)

**You're well within limits!** ✅

---

## ⚠️ Important: The "Sleep" Thing Explained

**Render Free Tier = Backend sleeps after 15 mins of no use**

What this means:
- First visitor: Waits 30-60 seconds (backend waking up)
- After that: Everyone gets instant access
- After 15 mins idle: Sleeps again

**For capstone project:** This is FINE because:
✅ Professors understand it's free hosting
✅ You can wake it up before presenting
✅ Once awake, works perfectly
✅ You can explain this in your report

**Pro tip:** Visit your backend URL 2-3 minutes before demo!
